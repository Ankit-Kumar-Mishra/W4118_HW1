About
============================
Shell is a simple C-based Shell.
It has support for 4 internal commands.
* exit : quits the shell
* cd : changes the current working directory for the shell.
* path : lists the internal PATH variable for this shell.
* history : lists a history of previous commands


How to Compile
===============
make clean && make all


How to Run
==================
You can run shell by running ./w4118_sh


Simple Sample Runs:
==================
./w4118_sh
$ /bin/ls
checkpatch.pl  main.o		   README	test.c	       w4118_sh
cs	       Makefile		   shell.c	test.h
diffpatch.txt  new_test_file	   shell.h	test.h.gch
hw1_test.py    pexpect-2.3	   shell.h.gch	test.o
main.c	       pexpect-2.3.tar.gz  shell.o	test_w4118_sh

$ /bin/pwd
/mnt/hgfs/Programming/C/OS/hmwk1/shell


Error Handling
=================
The shell will print out an error if an error condition is reached.
If the error is not recoverable, (for an example an out-of-memory error)
the shell will indicate this and exit.


Testing
=================
A Unit testing approach was taken to testing the fundamental pieces of the shell
program. These tests can be found in test.h test.c files. To run all unit tests
you can execute ./test_w4118_sh.

Furthermore, The shell program was tested by manually running it and executing different
command to see if they worked.
