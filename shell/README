About
============================
Shell is a simple C-based Shell.
It has support for 4 internal commands.
* exit : quits the shell
* cd : changes the current working directory for the shell.
* path : lists the internal PATH variable for this shell.
* history : lists a history of previous commands

It can also execute any external command. To run external commands,
we use an internal PATH list to keep track of folders to look for
executables. You can modify and add to this list using the internal
path command. Initially the PATH starts out empty.

How to Compile
===============
make clean && make all


How to Run
==================
You can run shell by running ./w4118_sh


Error Handling
=================
The shell will print out an error if an error condition is reached.
If the error is not recoverable, (for an example an out-of-memory error)
the shell will indicate this and exit.


Testing
=================
A Unit testing approach was taken to testing the fundamental pieces of the shell
program. These tests can be found in test.h test.c files. To run all unit tests
you can execute ./test_w4118_sh.

Furthermore, The shell program was tested by manually running it and executing different
commands to see if they worked.

I had also ran the given python test script and my shell passed that test as well.

Coding Style
=============
The code style used is consistent with that of the linux kernel coding style.
You can run the checkpatch.pl[1] with the arguments --no-tree -f [FILE_NAME]
to validate that the style was followed.

Example:
./checkpatch.pl --no-tree -f shell.c

[1] - You can download checkpath script from: https://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6/blob/master/scripts/checkpatch.pl

Memory Cleanup
==============
I have been vigilant in freeing up no longer un-needed memory that
was allocated on the heap so as to prevent memory leaks. That said,
I do not free all reachable heap memory right before I exit because
I assume that the operating system will handle this for me.

Sample Shell Run:
=================
Below is a sample shell run demonstrating the functionality that we had to implement.

./w4118_sh
